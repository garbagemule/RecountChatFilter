# RecountChatFilter
A tiny little addon for World of Warcraft that reduces Recount/Skada spam to clickable one-liners.

I got tired of people spamming their damage/healing meters from Recount/Skada in my chat frame, so to I wrote this addon. It works by listening for the Recount/Skada "headlines", and then for the next short period of time, it captures and filters out all of the datalines. The "headline" is turned into a clickable link, which displays a tooltip with the datalines in it when clicked.
